    Project Description:
    --------------------
    Our project is a social network.  It implements many of the typical social network features such as following users activity and interacting with users.  The main concept behind the site is seeing what the internet thinks of things.  The site is populated with “content” which can be anything from a thing in real life, to a website.  Users can either vote to like, or dislike this content.  The site then displays the ratio of likes to dislikes to show how positive or negative the internets reception of this content is.  Users are able to upload content, and vote on content.  Users are also able to “stalk” other users, which triggers that users activity to be shown in the “stalker’s” newsfeed (Similar to friending someone on Facebook, however it is not a mutual friendship).
