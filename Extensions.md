Extensions
------------
While we've managed to build a fairly complete web application, there are a few features that had to be cut out due to time restraints. Our original plan was to use the Facebook API to allow users to login with Facebook and access a user's Facebook likes and integrate those with our application. This could have been achieved using the "connect-auth" node module which supports authentication through Facebook. We had also hoped to be able to compare users by their likes and dislikes and calculate how similar two users are. 
We would also like to extend to the content objects to hold links and more dynamic content such as events.  There are also numerous social network features we did not have time to implement such as messaging and commenting.  These features could easily fit in with our current design; they would just need new tables in our database to be stored in, and new code to handle it.  One other feature, which could be implemented, is the ability to give reviews on top of your vote for content.  This could have been easily implemented by adding a new column in our Likes table for storing this review.  Finally, there is always room for increased performance and error checking, which was not given too much attention in this project.  I know for one, I would like to research more on creating a faster algorithm for generating our news feeds, although we were getting pretty good performance even with a test user base of 50,000.
