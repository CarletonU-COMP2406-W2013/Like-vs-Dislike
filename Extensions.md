While we've managed to build a fairly complete web application, there are a few features that had to be cut out due to time restraints. Our original plan was to use the Facebook API to allow users to login with Facebook and access a user's Facebook likes and integrate those with our application. This could have been acheived using the "connect-auth" node module which supports authentication through Facebook. We had also hoped to be able to compare users by their likes and dislikes and caclculate how similar two users are. 
We would also like to extend to the content objects to hold links.
